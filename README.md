## THE 4 FILES TO DOWNLOAD:

1. **index.html** - Main structure
2. **styles.css** - All styling (cards are 300×450, fan at bottom)
3. **script.js** - Constellation animation + card mechanics
4. **prompts-database.js** - **STORY SEEDS** (evocative, not prescriptive)

## STRUCTURE:

```
fateweaver/
├── index.html              ← Download
├── styles.css              ← Download
├── script.js               ← Download
├── prompts-database.js     ← Download (THIS ONE - Story Seeds!)
└── Assets/
    └── (all your 18 card images)
```

## WHAT'S IN PROMPTS-DATABASE.JS:

**Story seeds**, not complete stories!

**Example (GOOD):**
> "Your perfect solve rate has a pattern. Someone who looks exactly like you is creating the crimes."

**NOT this (TOO SPECIFIC):**
> "Your identical twin commits murders you solve to cover it up, but now they framed you for one you actually did."

**The prompts:**
- Suggest situations, don't dictate plots
- Create mystery, don't solve it
- Leave room for YOUR story
- Spark imagination

## TESTING:

1. Download the 4 files above
2. Put with your Assets folder
3. Open index.html
4. **Read a prompt** - should feel like a starting point, not a complete story!
